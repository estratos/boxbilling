## Reporting Vulnerabilities 
To report a vulnerability, please make a submission on [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose). Enter https://github.com/boxbilling/boxbilling as the repository and then go from there. Their website should give you a idea good on how to make a good vulnerability report.
It's important to make the submission there as it keeps the vulnerability private which helps ensure it can't be exploited while a patch is in the works. If you have a suggestion that is related to security, then [creating an issue](https://github.com/boxbilling/boxbilling/issues/new/choose) on GitHub is a suitable place.

Usually a good report should include which file(s) has the exploit, how the vulnerability could be exploited, the potential ramifications of the vulnerability, a proof of concept exploit, and if possible insight into a solution. A proper vulnerability report is awarded with a cash reward, if you provide a patch there is usually a reward with that as well.

**Reporting bugs**
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for BoxBilling. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª üíª, and find related reports üîé.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
Provide more context by answering these questions:

Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?
